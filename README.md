Highlights of and links to the games I made/make (especially in jams). 

# Jams

| Event | Status | Game | Link |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| LOWREZJAM 2018 | DNF | Originally a mash-up of crypt of the necrodancer and metroidvania games. Never finished due to life events at the time for team. | https://gitlab.com/fiblit/disco-theater
| OMGJam 4 | WIP! | A physics-based resource management game set in space. (I enjoyed making the game more than finishing it during the jam, haha.) | https://gitlab.com/fiblit/lut-voyage
| WGJ 50 | Backlog | "Remake a classic": A mash-up of Super Mario and Warcraft 1. I did not finish this due to overscoping the content and learning Lua. | https://gitlab.com/fiblit/super-war-koopas-and-toads
| GGJ18 | DNF | Puzzle solver where you have to work together with limited communication, with other fun effects. DNF due to losing team and assets. | https://gitlab.com/fiblit/proxima-centauri
| VGDC 18 | Backlog | 24 Hour Rendition of the "Clock Blockers" video | https://gitlab.com/fiblit/the-weekend-pub
| MFGJ 17 | Done! (may develop more) | Endless bullet-hell runner with hero-swapping mechanic | https://gitlab.com/fiblit/castle-trancelvania
| GGJ 17 | Done! | Sonar-vision dungeon crawler | https://gilab.com/fiblit/batsNeonNoir
